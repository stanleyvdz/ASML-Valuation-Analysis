**Recommendation: SELL** | Price Target: €490 | Current Price: €1,204 | Downside: −59%

## Executive Summary

ASML is one of the most extraordinary businesses in the world. It is the sole supplier of the Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines that every leading chipmaker — TSMC, Samsung, Intel — must use to manufacture chips at the most advanced nodes. There is no alternative. No company has come close to replicating it, and the technical barriers to entry are so high that this monopoly is not going away.

That, however, is exactly the problem. Everyone knows ASML is a great business. It has been priced accordingly for years, and at €1,204 per share, I believe the market has gone too far. My DCF model, built from the bottom up using five years of historical financials and a 10-year free cash flow projection, derives an intrinsic value of **€490 per share** — a 59% discount to the current price.

This is not a view that the business is deteriorating. It is a view that extraordinary businesses can still be overvalued, and that at the current price, the risk-reward is unfavourable.

## The Business

ASML designs and manufactures photolithography systems — the machines that "print" circuit patterns onto silicon wafers. Its EUV systems use light with a wavelength of 13.5 nanometres (compared to ~193nm for older DUV systems) to etch transistors at dimensions that are no longer visible to the human eye. Each EUV machine is the product of roughly 100,000 parts, takes around 40 truckloads and three cargo planes to ship, and costs approximately €200M. The next generation, High-NA EUV, costs more than €350M per unit.

The company's competitive position is essentially unassailable in the medium term. The physics required to develop EUV took decades and billions of euros; ASML has ~5,000 patents and a supplier ecosystem that took 30 years to build. Carl Zeiss makes the optics. No competitor is close to commercialisation. This is as close to a permanent competitive advantage as exists in the technology sector.

Financially, the business reflects this position. Revenue grew from €18.6B in 2021 to €32.7B in 2025, a 15.1% CAGR. Gross margins have been consistently above 50%, and the company converts a high proportion of earnings to free cash flow, generating €11B of FCF in 2025 on €9.6B of net income.

## Valuation

### DCF Analysis

I projected free cash flows for 10 years (2026–2035) using the following key assumptions:

| Assumption | Value | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Revenue growth 2026–2029 | 15% p.a. | In line with management guidance and backlog visibility |
| Revenue growth 2030–2032 | 10% p.a. | Gradual deceleration as TAM matures |
| Revenue growth 2033–2035 | 5% p.a. | Approaching terminal rate |
| Gross margin | 57% | Above 5-year average; reflects High-NA mix shift |
| EBIT margin | 37.5% | Conservative; in line with recent performance |
| Tax rate | 25% | Netherlands statutory rate |
| CapEx % of revenue | 9% | Historical average |
| WACC | 9.2% | CAPM (Rf 4.25%, β 1.35, MRP 6.5%) |
| Terminal growth | 2.5% | Nominal GDP growth |

**DCF Summary (EUR millions)**

| Component | Value |
|---|---|
| PV of FCFs (2026–2035) | €78,703M |
| PV of Terminal Value | €129,604M |
| Enterprise Value | €208,306M |
| Plus: Cash | €12,916M |
| Less: Debt | €30,955M |
| Equity Value | €190,267M |
| Shares Outstanding | 388M |
| **DCF Value Per Share** | **€490** |

The most notable output is the terminal value composition. At 62% of enterprise value, the terminal value dominates the result — meaning that more than half of what you are paying for today has nothing to do with ASML's performance over the next decade. You are paying primarily for the assumption that ASML will be a relevant, growing business in perpetuity. That assumption is probably correct. The question is what discount rate you apply to that perpetuity.

### Comparable Company Analysis

ASML trades broadly in line with its semiconductor equipment peers on most metrics, which is itself a telling datapoint. A business with a genuine monopoly, superior margins, and structural tailwinds from AI should arguably command a premium to Applied Materials, Lam Research, and KLA. The fact that it trades at roughly the same EV/EBITDA (38.1× vs. peer median 37.8×) suggests that either (a) the peers are also expensive, or (b) the market has become indiscriminate in its enthusiasm for semiconductor names. I suspect both are partially true.

At sector median EV/EBITDA, ASML would be worth approximately €975 per share — still 19% below the current price, but a much more modest discount than the DCF implies. This gives me some pause about the severity of the SELL signal, and is worth monitoring as a re-rating risk if sentiment shifts.

### Sensitivity Analysis

I tested 88 combinations of WACC (8% to 13%) and terminal growth (1.5% to 5%). The current price of €1,204 lies above every single scenario modelled. Even with an 8% WACC — which assumes near-zero credit risk and a compressed equity premium — and a 5% terminal growth rate — which is essentially the long-run growth rate of a developing economy — the model yields €1,018. The stock has to either grow faster than I modelled, or be valued on an entirely different basis (optionality, strategic scarcity), for the current price to be justifiable on fundamentals.

## Investment Thesis — Why SELL?

**1. The AI narrative is real but already in the price.**
TSMC's capacity expansion and NVIDIA's demand pull have created genuine urgency around advanced node lithography. ASML's backlog reportedly exceeds €36B. But a backlog, by definition, reflects future revenue that the market has already anticipated. Revenue expectations for 2026–2028 are aggressive, and any guidance miss — even a minor one — would likely trigger a sharp de-rating given the multiple.

**2. Geopolitical risk is underappreciated.**
The Dutch government, under US pressure, has significantly restricted ASML's ability to service and ship DUV equipment to Chinese customers. China accounted for roughly 17% of ASML's 2024 revenue. If restrictions escalate further — and the political trajectory suggests they might — the revenue impact could be material and the market has not fully priced this in.

**3. The semiconductor cycle is inherently volatile.**
The industry is cyclical. Memory customers (Samsung, SK Hynix) have historically pulled back orders sharply during downturns. Even if ASML's EUV business remains structurally robust, a 12–18 month order pause from memory customers alone could pressure near-term results and sentiment, potentially triggering multiple compression at the worst possible time.

**4. The WACC assumption matters enormously.**
At a 9.2% WACC, the base case DCF is €490. A 100bps reduction to 8.2% pushes the value to approximately €600. A 100bps increase to 10.2% drops it to approximately €410. The stock's sensitivity to the discount rate assumption is extreme, which means the current valuation is highly dependent on interest rates staying lower than their current level for a sustained period. That is not an obvious bet.

## Risks to the Bear Case

I want to be honest about the ways this analysis could be wrong:

**High-NA adoption accelerates.** If TSMC and Samsung adopt High-NA EUV systems at 2× the pace assumed, ASML's revenue and margin profile for 2027–2030 could be materially above my projections. High-NA systems carry higher ASPs and likely better margins as the learning curve matures.

**China restrictions are relaxed.** A change in geopolitical context — US-China trade détente, a new administration's policy recalibration — could restore Chinese revenue faster than expected.

**The multiple expands.** Markets can stay irrational for extended periods. If the AI capex cycle sustains itself and ASML remains the clear bottleneck, the stock could continue re-rating even as the DCF gap widens. Being right on valuation but wrong on timing is still painful.

---

## Conclusion

ASML is a world-class business. The competitive moat is real, the margins are exceptional, and the long-term demand driver — the relentless march toward smaller transistors — is not going away. If I were building a 20-year portfolio, ASML would be on my watchlist at the right price.

The right price is not €1,204.

My DCF analysis, stress-tested across dozens of scenarios, consistently implies a fair value well below the current trading price. The comparable company analysis provides partial support for the market price but not at today's multiple. The sensitivity analysis shows that even in the most aggressive scenario I am willing to defend, the stock barely approaches €1,000.

For a new position, the risk-reward is clearly unfavourable. The recommendation is SELL.
